After passing the minigames with sucess, you can return back home and see your results on your profile, or maybe you prefer to travel and repeat any of these three minigames... You can play whenever you feel like doing so, and keep in mind:

"Time is not an enemy to be defeated, but a friend to be harmonized with. The real victory is not in rushing to the end, but in enjoying the journey... So, traveler, I invite you to take your time. Take a deep breath, look around you and immerse yourself in the magic of this universe. Because every time you play, remember that it's not the destination that matters, it's the journey."
